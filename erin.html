							<h2>Evidence</h2><br>

							<p> "We were expected to be enthusiastic Christians." </p><p>"I started rebelling in minor ways."</p><br>
							<h2>Explanation</h2>
							<p> 
								Erin lived in a conservative family and was burdened with high expectations. 
								
								When Erin kissed for the first time, she wondered if that was too much and doubted herself, although she was happy too.  I do not see any sign of rebellion in these actions, but how Erin criticizes herself for doing these manifests that she is going through inner struggles. She also hasn't been through enough and seen enough under her family's protection. 

								This has come from her having an overly strict family, which causes children to doubt themselves and lose confidence in their actions. 
								
								In life, parents should put a certain amount of restrictions on their children, but not too much to the extent that children feel suppressed or are oblivious of what the world is like. </p> <br>

							<h2>Connection</h2>
							<p> refuting her stereotype 
								she said her father was a bastist pastor and was strict so it affected their relationship 
							</p> <br>
