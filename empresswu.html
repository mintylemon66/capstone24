							<h2>Evidence</h2><br>
<p>"Whether completely deserved or not, Wu has a reputation of being one of the most cruel rulers in China’s history. She remains a controversial figure primarily because of stories about her personal actions against rivals. Male Confucian officials who were deeply prejudiced against strong and ambitious women undoubtedly exaggerated this aspect of Wu’s life in later accounts of her reign." (Lee 14)</p> 
							<h2>Explanation</h2>
							<p> Wu Zetian justified her rule by incorporating women into governance, showcasing progressive leadership that challenged traditional gender norms. The efficiency and success of her administration, bolstered by female officials, served as evidence of her capable governance.</p><p>Wu challenged the prevailing view that women could only exert influence through male affiliations. This move not only enhanced the perception and status of women in society but also questioned the established gender dynamics. This is beneficial for her reign because it increases their positions in society and others realize that women are as competent as men can be. </p> <p>Empress Wu was a controversial figure because she was female, and that gave her a lot more standards to meet compared to her male counterparts. She has to be a competent power-holder and at the same time be a stereotypically feminine person, which she is not. </p><p>savannah</p><br>
