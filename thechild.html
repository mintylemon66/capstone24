							<h2>Evidence</h2>

							<p>"It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its
								existence, that makes possible the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the
								profundity of their science. It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. They know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, could make no joyful music as the young riders line up in their beauty for the race in the
								
								sunlight of the first morning of summer." (LeGuin, 4)</p>  <br>
							<h2>Explanation</h2>
							<p>After seeing the child in the basement, most people stay in Omelas, although they know the child is suffering. 

							</p> <br>

							<h2>Connection</h2>
							<p>
								The child is a major twist because it is completely contrary to something in a utopia. 
								
								The residents in Omelas believe that as long as the child suffers, they can remain in happiness. The child symbolizes those who suffer in our society. Those who stay in Omelas symbolize most people in society who know that others are suffering but ignore it and move on. They know that people suffer to give them the life they have now, but they do nothing about it and neglect the suffering. This is a part of human nature since they crave a high living quality despite it being based on many people's sufferings.  
								
								  </p><p>Omelas is double-sided because it can be positive and negative. It represents one can’t gain something without suffering. 

									There are people who refuse to benefit from the suffering of others, but they are still no help to the suffering. They take the burden off from their conscience, but they are not stopping it from happening. One gets the sense of how the ones who walk away should receive praise but those who have never done anything constructive for the suffering. 
									
									They are not heroes, but not villains either. They are the type of person, especially those from the authorities, that talk about the issue but never address it constructively. </p> <br>
